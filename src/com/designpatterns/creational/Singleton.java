 * Below implementation is a lazy implementation.

 * When to Use Singleton Design Pattern
 *
 *	For resources that are expensive to create (like database connection objects)
 *	Itâ€™s good practice to keep all loggers as Singletons which increases performance
 *	Classes which provide access to configuration settings for the application
 *	Classes that contain resources that are accessed in shared mode
